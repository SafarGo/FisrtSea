-  Authentic Storm Feel : Combined rain + lightning effects

📅 Seasonal System
-  4 Seasons : Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter
-  365-Day Calendar : Realistic yearly progression
-  Season-Based Weather : Different weather patterns per season
-  Customizable Duration : Configurable days per season

⚡ Performance Optimizations
-  Cached Components : Reduced GetComponent calls
-  Delta Checking : Only update when values change significantly
-  Optimized Update Rates : Different frequencies for different systems
-  Low Performance Mode : Reduced particle rates for better FPS

🎮 Quick Start

1. Setup Requirements
- Unity 2021.3 or newer
- HDRP (High Definition Render Pipeline)
- Visual Effect Graph (for particles)

2. Basic Setup
    1. Import the Weather System package
    2. Add the `CycleManager` script to an empty GameObject
    3. Assign your Sun and Moon lights
    4. Create Volume components for clouds and sky
    5. Assign particle systems for weather effects

3. Essential Volumes Setup

 Cloud Volume
```
Create > Volume > Global Volume
Add Override > Lighting > Volumetric Clouds
Assign to "Cloud Volume" field in CycleManager
```

 Sky Volume
```
Create > Volume > Global Volume  
Add Override > Sky > Physically Based Sky
Assign to "Sky Volume" field in CycleManager
```

🔧 Configuration

 Time & Progression
-  Current Time : 0-24 hour format
-  Time Speed : Multiplier for time progression
-  Season Speed : Controls seasonal changes
-  Days Per Season : Default 91 days (365 total)

 Weather Settings
-  Weather Duration : Min/Max hours between changes
-  Seasonal Probabilities : Customize weather chances per season
-  Cloud Densities : Different values per weather type

🎯 Usage Examples

 Force Weather Change
```csharp
CycleManager weatherSystem = FindObjectOfType<CycleManager>();
weatherSystem.SetWeather(WeatherType.Thunderstorm);
```

 Change Season
```csharp
weatherSystem.SetSeason(Season.Winter);
```

 Get Current Progress
```csharp
float yearProgress = weatherSystem.GetYearProgress(); // 0-1
float seasonProgress = weatherSystem.GetSeasonProgress(); // 0-1
```

 Refresh Components
```csharp
weatherSystem.RefreshCachedComponents();
```

🏗️ Architecture

 Core Components
-  CycleManager : Main controller script
-  Weather Enums : Season and WeatherType definitions
-  Performance Cache : Optimized component references
-  Smooth Transitions : Interpolated value changes

 Update Frequencies
-  Time Progression : Every frame (essential)
-  Lighting Updates : 30 FPS (smooth but optimized)
-  Weather System : 10 FPS (responsive)
-  Cloud/Sky Updates : Only when needed

⚠️ Important Notes

 Sun Light Control
- Sun intensity and temperature are  manually controlled 
- Sun position, rotation, and shadows are  script-controlled 
- This allows for custom sun setups while maintaining automation

 Moon Light Control
- Fully automated including intensity and temperature
- Realistic lunar cycle with phase-based brightness
- 30-day lunar calendar system

 Performance Considerations
- Use "Low Particle Mode" on mobile devices
- Consider "Disable Cloud Updates" for very low-end hardware
- "Simplified Weather Intensity" reduces calculations

🔍 Troubleshooting

 Sky Not Darkening During Storms
1. Ensure Sky Volume is assigned
2. Check Physically Based Sky component exists
3. Verify exposure values are different enough
4. Call `RefreshCachedComponents()` if needed

 Particles Not Showing
1. Check particle systems are assigned
2. Verify Visual Effect Graph is installed
3. Ensure particle materials are assigned
4. Check "Low Particle Mode" setting

 Performance Issues
1. Enable "Low Particle Mode"
2. Consider "Disable Cloud Updates"
3. Reduce "Sky Transition Speed"
4. Check Update frequencies in profiler
